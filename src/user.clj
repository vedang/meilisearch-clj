;; Continuing on from previous example, let's formalize things a bit
;; and see the status of our task.

;; ## Basic Search

;; A basic search can be performed by calling the `search` method,
;; with a simple string query.

;; First, let's make sure our documents have been added, and wait for
;; the task to succeed.

(rcf/tests
 (loop [num-attempts 5]
   (let [task (core/get-task client (:task-uid task-info))]
     (when (not= "succeeded" (:status task))
       (if (pos? num-attempts)
         (do (Thread/sleep 500)
             (recur (dec num-attempts)))
         (do (println "Exhausted attempts, something is wrong with our server")
             (println task)))))))

;; Now we are ready to search

(def index "The Movies Index against which we want to execute a search"
  (core/index client "movies"))

(rcf/tests
 (core/search index "life")
 := {:hits '({:genres ["Drama" "Adventure"],
             :id 3.0,
